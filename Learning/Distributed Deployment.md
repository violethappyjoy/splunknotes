## Key factors that determine the type of deployment
- **Indexing volume.** How much data are you planning to index on a daily basis? To handle increased indexing loads, you might need multiple [**indexers**](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Indexer "Splexicon:Indexer").
- **Number and type of searches.** How frequently will you be running searches, either scheduled or ad hoc? What type of searches will you be running? Large numbers of searches, or frequent process-intensive searches, can tax both [**search head**](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchhead "Splexicon:Searchhead") and indexer resources.
- **Number of concurrent users.** How many users will be viewing dashboards or running searches concurrently? To handle increased numbers of users, you might need to add search heads, usually through a [**search head cluster**](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchheadcluster "Splexicon:Searchheadcluster").
- **Data fidelity requirements.** If you must ensure that the system never loses data, an [**indexer cluster**](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Indexercluster "Splexicon:Indexercluster") is a necessity.
- **Availability requirements.** What requirements do you have for data availability? If you must always have access to the full set of data, you might need to deploy both an indexer cluster and a search head cluster.
- **Disaster recovery requirements.** How important is fast disaster recovery? A [**multisite indexer cluster**](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Multisitecluster "Splexicon:Multisitecluster") can ensure fast failover to identical sets of data across geographically dispersed data centers.
## Representative deployment types

These are some of the main types of deployments, based on size:

- **[Departmental.](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.0/Deploy/Singleindexer)** A single instance that combines indexing and search management functions.
  [![Departmental deployment.png](https://docs.splunk.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Departmental_deployment.png/700px-Departmental_deployment.png)](https://docs.splunk.com/File:Departmental_deployment.png)
- **Small enterprise.** One search head with two or three indexers.
- **Medium enterprise.** A small search head cluster, with several indexers.
- **Large enterprise.** A large search head cluster, with large numbers of indexers.
