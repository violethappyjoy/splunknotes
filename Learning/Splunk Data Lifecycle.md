## How Splunk stores data?
### How Are Events Stored?
==Events/Logs => Buckets => Indexes => Indexers==
In Splunk, events (logs or machine data) are stored and organized systematically as follows:
1. Events/Logs: Raw data generated by systems, applications, or devices are ingested into Splunk.
2. Buckets: The ingested data is segmented into "buckets," which are time-based file directories where raw data and metadata are stored.
3. Indexes: Buckets are part of indexes, which serve as logical containers that organize and provide efficient access to the data.
4. Indexers: Indexers are Splunk components responsible for processing incoming data, storing it in buckets within the appropriate index, and making it searchable.
