## How Splunk stores data?
### How Are Events Stored?
==Events/Logs => Buckets => Indexes => Indexers==
In Splunk, events (logs or machine data) are stored and organized systematically as follows:
1. Events/Logs: Raw data generated by systems, applications, or devices are ingested into Splunk.
2. [[Buckets]]: The ingested data is segmented into "buckets," which are time-based file directories where raw data and metadata are stored.
3. Indexes: Buckets are part of indexes, which serve as logical containers that organize and provide efficient access to the data.
4. Indexers: Indexers are Splunk components responsible for processing incoming data, storing it in buckets within the appropriate index, and making it searchable.
### How data ages?
As buckets age, they "roll" from one state to the next. 
- Hot to Warm: Rolls when conditions like bucket size or indexer restart are met; renamed but stays in the same location.
- Warm to Cold: Rolls when the maximum number of warm buckets is reached; oldest warm bucket rolls first. Cold buckets reside in a different, often cheaper, storage location.
- Cold to Frozen: Rolls based on time or size conditions; frozen buckets are deleted after optional archiving.
- Frozen to Thawed: Archived frozen data can be thawed and made searchable, if and only if it is configured to do so.
- Config Control: Bucket transitions are governed by settings in **indexes.conf**.
