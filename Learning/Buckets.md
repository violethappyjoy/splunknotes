| Hot          | Newly ingested data is written to “hot” buckets.                                                                                                                                                   | Homepath                                                                  | Yes                                      | Active buckets where events are being indexed. Multiple hot buckets can exist at a time.                                                                |
| Warm         | Buckets rolled from hot. New data is not written to warm buckets. An index has many warm buckets.                                                                                                  | Homepath                                                                  | Yes                                      | Warm buckets are read-only but remain readily searchable.                                                                                               |
| Cold         | Buckets rolled from warm and moved to a different location. An index has many cold buckets.                                                                                                        | ColdPath                                                                  | Yes (slightly slower compared to warm)   | Cold buckets are typically stored on cheaper storage compared to hot and warm buckets.                                                                  |
| Frozen       | Buckets rolled from cold. The indexer deletes frozen buckets, but you can choose to archive them first. Archived buckets can later be thawed.                                                      | In *coldToFrozenDir* or *coldToFrozenScript* (if configured else deleted) | No (can be re-ingested back into Splunk) | Data in the frozen stage has been removed from the index after reaching retention limits in the cold stage. It is no longer actively managed by Splunk. |
| Thawed       | Buckets restored from an archive. If you archive frozen buckets, you can later return them to the index by thawing them.                                                                           | thawedPath (defined in indexes.cof)                                       | Yes                                      | It exists outside the regular hot-warm-cold-frozen lifecycle. Data must be manually moved to the thawed path for Splunk to recognize and search it.     |
| TSIDX Reduce | TSIDX (time-series index) files are Splunk’s indexing structures for efficient search. TSIDX Reduction is a process to minimize storage used by cold buckets by removing parts of the TSIDX files. |                                                                           | Yes but slower                           | Reduces the size of index files in cold buckets by removing event-level indexing metadata.                                                              |
**Hot, Warm, Cold, Frozen(Delete)** are enabled out of the box.
