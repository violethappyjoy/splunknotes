## Step 1 & 2 - Installation of Splunk
- Download using `wget` from [Splunk Website](https://www.splunk.com)
- On Ubuntu instance: [[Installation using .deb]] or [[Installation using .tar]]
- On Red Hat Instance: [[Installation on Red Hat(.rpm)]]
- Configure SH, LM DS and DMC
- Disable UI
## Terminology
-  **Search Head (SH)**
    - A Splunk instance that handles user searches.
    - The SH distributes search requests to indexers and consolidates the results.
    - In distributed environments, you typically have one or more SHs so users can run searches against data residing on multiple indexers.
- **License Master (LM)**
    - The Splunk instance that manages licensing for all other Splunk components in your environment (search heads, indexers, etc.).
    - Ensures you do not exceed your purchased ingestion daily volume.
    - All other Splunk instances must communicate with the LM to stay compliant.
- **Deployment Server (DS)**
    - Central configuration manager for Splunk forwarders (and sometimes other Splunk instances).
    - You create “apps” or “server classes” on the DS, which push configuration files (inputs.conf, outputs.conf, etc.) to forwarders.
    - Greatly simplifies large-scale management of Splunk configs.
- **Distributed Management Console (DMC)**
    - Provides an overview of the entire Splunk deployment’s health, performance metrics, indexing throughput, search concurrency, etc.
    - Typically enabled on one Splunk instance (often on a search head) to gain insights into the environment.
